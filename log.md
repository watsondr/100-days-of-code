**Today's Progress**: Finished 1 FCC challenge

### Day 6: January 7, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished 2 FCC challenges: Search & Replace and Pig Latin

**Thoughts:**  Difficult day to concentrate as work starts tomorrow. Did about 90 minutes all up but wasn't present throughout. Hopefully I've offset this by knocking 2 simpler challenges for me out of the way. Also spent a lot of time looking in to Regex and trying to minimise lines of code as I completed the tasks.

### Day 5: January 6, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished a FreeCodeCamp challenge that took day 4 & 5.

**Thoughts:**  Absolutely stoked. Finished the 'Wherefore art thou' challenge. Take two parameters, 1 object array & an object, then add objects from the array that contain the separate objects' key and value pairs. No spoilers, just pseudocode and finding answers along the way.

### Day 4: January 5, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started a freecodecamp challenge.

**Thoughts:**  The challenge is to use two parameters in a function, 1 an array of objects the other an object, and use the properties of the object to add objects to a new array, copied from the provided array.

### Day 3: January 4, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished a FreeCodeCamp challenge. - technically day 4 but have not gone to bed yet.

**Thoughts:**  Hated this challenge. Really struggled with the conversion method but I understand how the 'basic' solution works, how it came from older java solutions I came across on stack overflow. I originally wanted to do a switch but really couldn't picture how to process remainders. This is an issue where if you have a remainder that needs to key to a floor of 1, recursion is definitely the simplest approach.

### Day 2: January 3, 2018

**Today's Progress**:  Today I migrated my website to Font Awesome version 5. Changed some website text. Moved my portfolio card icons to font awesome for consistency purposes. Finished a FreeCodeCamp challenge.

**Thoughts:**  Assumed it would be simple but syntax changes and moving from a remote script to a local file took more time than expected. Was very quick by the time I got to changing my portfolio card icons. My FreeCodeCamp challenge took a while due to understanding ES2015 and discovering babbel.

### Day 1: January 2, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed 1 challenge on FCC where I had previously left off.

**Thoughts:** Getting back in to JavaScript was difficult as my previous project was mainly done in PHP / HTML / CSS with minimal Javascript. Found it very easy to comment along the plan to tackle the challenge once I saw the scope.
