# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 2: January 3, 2018

**Today's Progress**:  Today I migrated my website to Font Awesome version 5. Changed some website text. Moved my portfolio card icons to font awesome for consistency purposes. Finished a FreeCodeCamp challenge.

**Thoughts:**  Assumed it would be simple but syntax changes and moving from a remote script to a local file took more time than expected. Was very quick by the time I got to changing my portfolio card icons. My FreeCodeCamp challenge took a while due to understanding ES2015 and discovering babbel.

### Day 1: January 2, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed 1 challenge on FCC where I had previously left off.

**Thoughts:** Getting back in to JavaScript was difficult as my previous project was mainly done in PHP / HTML / CSS with minimal Javascript. Found it very easy to comment along the plan to tackle the challenge once I saw the scope.
